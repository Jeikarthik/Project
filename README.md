# give me a README file to add for this entire project

Here is a complete, copy‑paste‑ready README for the integrated project repository.[^1][^2]

# Cognito Nexus — AI Document Workflow Platform[^2][^1]

This repository orchestrates ingestion, pre‑OCR classification, OCR, NLP insights, multi‑department routing, and a web UI for metro/enterprise document operations.[^1][^2]

## Overview[^2][^1]

- Ingests documents from Email, SharePoint, WhatsApp, Maximo exports, and scans, then applies fast pre‑OCR rules by channel, filename, and extension.[^3][^2]
- Executes OCR and AI understanding to generate labels, entities, deadlines, and tasks, then fans out to departments like Finance, Procurement, Operations, Compliance, Maintenance, HR, and Rolling Stock per mapped needs.[^1][^2]
- Provides dashboards, notifications, and a searchable archive so teams can act quickly and track accountability.[^2][^1]


## Repository layout[^1][^2]

- frontend/ — Web UI for upload, search, tasks, and chat.[^2][^1]
- backend/ — FastAPI service for ingestion, routing, tasks, and RAG endpoints.[^1][^2]
- ocr_service/ — OCR and layout extraction microservice.[^3][^2]
- transformer/ — Lightweight classifier and Mistral-powered NLP endpoints.[^2][^1]
- docker-compose.yml — Local integration of all services.[^4][^2]

If each component lives in a separate GitHub repo, add them here as Git submodules so they appear as folders in this integration repo.[^5][^6]

## Quick start (Docker)[^7][^4]

- Prerequisites: Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose.[^4]
- Clone this repo and initialize submodules if used:
    - git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url> \&\& cd my-workflow-project.[^5]
- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in required keys.[^4]
- Build and run:
    - docker compose build \&\& docker compose up.[^8]
- Access: frontend http://localhost:3000, backend http://localhost:5000, OCR http://localhost:5001, transformer http://localhost:5002.[^4]

Tip: Compose can also build services directly from Git URLs if you prefer not to check out subfolders locally.[^7]

## Environment variables[^9][^4]

- BACKEND_URL, FRONTEND_URL, OCR_URL, TRANSFORMER_URL for internal calls and CORS.[^4]
- MISTRAL_API_KEY for Mistral chat completions used in classification, extraction, summaries, and chatbot.[^10][^9]
- Channel connectors: email/Graph credentials, SharePoint site and library paths, WhatsApp Cloud API creds, and Maximo export locations as per deployment.[^2]


## Pre‑OCR classification (Stage‑1)[^3][^2]

- When a file arrives, capture channel, folder/library, filename, and extension, then assign preliminary departments using channel/source bias plus filename and extension rules.[^3]
- Examples: SharePoint/HR library → HR; Maximo exports → Maintenance and Rolling Stock; PO_*.pdf → Procurement and Finance; roster_*.xlsx → HR and Operations; WhatsApp notice images → Operations and Compliance.[^3][^2]
- Files are stored in a staging path and marked with “preliminary departments,” deferring only ambiguous or special files (archives, encrypted PDFs) to OCR/AI.[^3]


## OCR and content understanding (Stage‑2)[^1][^2]

- Run OCR and extract text, tables, and structure for scans, images, and complex PDFs.[^2]
- Use Mistral chat completion to enrich labels, extract entities (dates, amounts, PO/invoice IDs), detect actions, and produce summaries for routing and dashboards.[^9][^10]
- Fan‑out to multiple departments based on final labels and entities mapped to roles like Finance, Procurement, Operations, Compliance, Maintenance, HR, and Rolling Stock.[^1][^2]


## Mistral integration (examples)[^10][^9]

- Deep semantic classification: Send OCR text and return JSON of departments and labels beyond filename heuristics.[^9]
- Entity and action extraction: Return dates, PO/invoice numbers, amounts, and action items for task creation.[^10]
- Summarization and chatbot: Generate 2–3 line summaries or answer Q\&A over retrieved document text via chat completions.[^9]


## Department mapping and routing[^1][^2]

- Maintain Tag→Department and Channel/Folder→Department tables seeded from known scenarios like invoices/POs → Finance/Procurement, rosters/policies → HR/Operations, job cards/inspections → Maintenance/Rolling Stock, and safety/incident bulletins → Operations/Compliance.[^2][^1]
- On classification, create a single immutable document record, then insert a delivery row per receiving department inbox plus an entry in a global searchable archive.[^1][^2]


## Developer workflow (submodules)[^11][^5]

- Add each component: git submodule add <repo> frontend|backend|ocr_service|transformer. [^5]
- Clone with modules: git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>.[^5]
- Update modules: git submodule update --init --recursive.[^5]
- Submodule metadata is managed in .gitmodules so paths and URLs are reproducible for the whole team.[^11]


## Compose services and networking[^7][^4]

- Each folder contains a Dockerfile; docker-compose.yml builds images and exposes ports 3000, 5000, 5001, and 5002 by default.[^4]
- Services communicate on a private Docker network using service names as hostnames (e.g., backend calls http://ocr:5001 and http://transformer:5002).[^4]
- Compose build contexts can be local folders or Git URLs, and you can override Dockerfile names via the dockerfile field.[^7]


## Channels and data types reference[^2][^1]

- Email: reports, invoices, bulletins, and scans with mixed text and attachments.[^2]
- SharePoint: HR policies, drawings, SOPs, and PDFs with embedded tables.[^2]
- Maximo exports: job cards, asset logs, and maintenance CSV/PDF data routed to relevant engineering teams.[^2]
- WhatsApp: images/PDF notices and urgent field updates largely consumed by operations and compliance teams.[^2]


## Roles and typical usage[^1]

- Finance/Procurement: vendor invoices, purchase orders, and budget approvals.[^1]
- Maintenance/Rolling Stock: job cards, inspection statuses, and spare‑part requests.[^1]
- Operations/Compliance: shift alerts, safety bulletins, incidents, and regulatory circulars.[^1]
- HR/Administration: staff rosters, policies, training notices, and leave approvals.[^1]


## Security and secrets[^4]

- Store API keys and credentials in environment variables or Compose secrets rather than committing them to source control.[^4]
- Limit service ports to what the UI and integrations need and prefer network‑internal calls between services.[^4]


## How to extend[^2][^1]

- Add more channel connectors or SharePoint libraries and update Channel/Folder biases for instant pre‑OCR routing.[^2]
- Expand Tag→Department mappings and keywords as new real‑world documents appear across roles and departments.[^1]
- Introduce IoT/UNS stream adapters to convert sensor alerts into tasks and documentation requirements using the same routing fabric.[^1][^2]


## License[^2][^1]

- Add your chosen license file (MIT/Apache‑2.0) at the repository root for clarity on usage and contributions.[^1][^2]
